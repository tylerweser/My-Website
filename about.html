    <h1>A Brief Moment On My Story &#128214;</h1>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLearning to code has been something I had always wanted to do, but never seemed to be able to grasp when I was younger. <br>

    That was until recently, when my interest and drive to problem solve and create new things inspired me to push past the barrier to learn to code. <br>
    I chose web development as my starting point. Why?

      <ol>
        <li>I love to design things.</li>

        <li>I have many exciting ideas and projects I would love to create using web applications/pages.</li>

        <li>I saw a need in the community and knew this was a perfect opportunity for me to help out while learning.</li>

      </ol>

    <h1>What I do and How I do it &#128187;</h1>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this industry, the phrase “there’s always more to learn” is especially true. I am proficient in site anatomy, HTML, CSS, and
       know the basics of Javascript, PHP, and SEO. Thus, it makes me perfectly suited to make beautiful front-end sites for smaller businesses like restaurants.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs stated I do not use any templates, frameworks, or other web building tools. 
      I code it all from scratch. If you are a small business owner or professional looking to have your 
      own site and are interested in my services,
