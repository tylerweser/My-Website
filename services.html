        I understand things are getting more expensive with the times, and that website creation can be daunting. The average cost for a website’s design for a small business is <b>$3200</b>, not including the cost of the domain name, hosting, SSL certificates, and more.
        <br><br>
        Such prices are simply too high for many business owners. And although cheaper alternatives exist, they always lack full customization and control. That’s why I design sites for much less than half of that price from scratch.

        <ol>
            <li>Once the form is received or I get the email, text, or call, I’ll need a 10% down payment as commitment, and after that, you don’t pay anything else until you’re happy with your website!</li>
            <li>Once the payment is received, I will send over a fun form through email to get the customization and specifications you’d like out of your website. I will also send over my recommendations based on what I know about successful website anatomy. <br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  &#8226  Optionally, If you would like pictures or videos taken, please let me know.</li>
            <li>When I get the form information back I will begin working and get it back to you as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>We then just need to link over a domain name and it will all be complete! From here you only pay for hosting and I will help tweak or apply any minor changes free of charge.</li>
